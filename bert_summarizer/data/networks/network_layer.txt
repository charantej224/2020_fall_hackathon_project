Layer-3 in the OSI model is called Network layer. Network layer manages options pertaining to host and network addressing, managing sub-networks,
and internet working.Network layer takes the responsibility for routing packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet. Two different subnet
 may have different addressing schemes or non-compatible addressing types. Same with protocols, two different subnet may be operating on different
 protocols which are not compatible with each other. Network layer has the responsibility to route the packets from source to destination, mapping
 different addressing schemes and protocols.
Devices which work on Network Layer mainly focus on routing. Routing may include various tasks aimed to achieve a single goal. These can be:
Addressing devices and networks.
Populating routing tables or static routes.
Queuing incoming and outgoing data and then forwarding them according to quality of service constraints set for those packets.
Internet working between two different subnets.
Delivering packets to destination with best efforts.
Provides connection oriented and connection less mechanism.
Quality of service management
Load balancing and link management
Security
Interrelation of different protocols and subnets with different schema.
Different logical network design over the physical network design.
L3 VPN and tunnels can be used to provide end to end dedicated connectivity.
Network address can be of classified as 4 types:
Uni-cast (destined to one host)
Multicast (destined to group)
Broadcast (destined to all)
Any-cast (destined to nearest one)
Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)
Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
